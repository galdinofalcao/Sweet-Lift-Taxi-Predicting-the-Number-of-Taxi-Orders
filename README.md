# Sweet-Lift-Taxi-Predicting-the-Number-of-Taxi-Orders

## **Description of the Problem:**
Sweet Lift Taxi is focused on increasing driver availability during peak hours by harnessing machine learning to develop a forecasting model that predicts taxi orders for the upcoming hour.

## **Project Goal:**
The project's objective is to evaluate various time series models to forecast taxi orders for the upcoming hour, with the aim of selecting the best model that achieves an RMSE below 48.

## **Tools and Libraries:**
- Python: Use Python programming language for data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- Statsmodels: Use for econometric and time series analyses, offering support for seasonal decomposition.
- Pandas: Manipulate and preprocess the data efficiently.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Create visualizations and charts for data exploration and presentation.
- Scikit-Learn (Sklearn): Model training, cross-validation, evaluation, and selection.

## **Data Documentation:**
The dataset contains the historical number of orders. The information given is as follows:
- taxi â€” source dataset
